--------------------

spice-vdagent-0.12.0
--------------------
* Full multi-monitor and arbritary resolution support, this requires a new
  enough xorg-x11-drv-qxl driver, as well as a new enough host

* Use syslog for logging, rather then logging to private log files

spice-vdagent-0.10.1

  instead of console-kit

spice-vdagent-0.8.1
-------------------
* In daemon mode the session vdagent now retries connecting to the system
  vdagentd every second, once a connection is made a version check is done,
  if the version differs (which only happens on an upgrade from one version
  to the next) the sesion vdagent re-execs itself (Marc-André Lureau)

spice-vdagent-0.8.0
-------------------
* Add support for copy and paste using the primary selection, to use this
  you need a spice-gtk widget based client and the latest spice-gtk code

  as RHEL-5 (Christophe Fergeau)
